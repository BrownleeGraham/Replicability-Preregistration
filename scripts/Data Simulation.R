#Here we are going to generate some data that reflects the growth of the sea star#

#Setting the seed to get reproducible random numbers, this vaslue is arbitraty#
set.seed(2020)

#Next we need to determine the number of observations we will take#
# use code *n <- VALUE* when we know what this value will be#

#We will want a normal distribution, we will have to extract the mean and std from the paper#
# x <- rnorm(n = VALUE, mean = u, sd = std)#
